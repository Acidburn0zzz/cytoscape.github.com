      <p>
      A cash prize was awarded to the students who have demonstrated
      excellence in Cytoscape-related development selected from the
      2013 Google Summer of Code student pool. The winning students
      were announced at the Cytoscape Symposium and Workshop in Paris,
      France on October 9-10, 2013. Selection took into consideration
      the many aspects of Allan's perpective and contributions to
      Cytoscape and software development, including his passions for:
      <ul>
        <li>Mentoring software developers</li>
        <li>Open source code</li>
        <li>Good user-centered design and execution</li>
        <li>Network biology tools/resources/applications</li>
        <li>Cytoscape core and app development</li>

      <h2>In dedication to</h2>
      <p>
      Allan J. Kuchinsky was a member of Agilent Labs working in
      molecular data analysis.  His 35-year career at Agilent
      Technologies and Hewlett Packard included work in data
      visualization, human-computer interaction and computational biology.
      His expertise led him to the Cytoscape community, which he joined in
      2005. He was a tireless champion for Cytoscape and open source
      software at Agilent and was a significant thought leader in the
      Cytoscape project.  Because of his passion for mentoring students,
      he also contributed significantly to Cytoscapeâ€™s Google Summer of
      Code effort.  We lost Allan in 2013 after a battle against cancer
      and we hope to honor his contributions to Cytoscape as a software
      developer and mentor with this prize.
